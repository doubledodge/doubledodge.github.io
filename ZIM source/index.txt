====== Welcome ======

This is the index page for my github projects.  Currently there is only one project uploaded: the bashpop3 project.  This is a Linux bash script that checks mail on a POP3 email server, allowing emails to be examined and junk to be deleted before mail is download with a regular mail client

The general documentation for the bashpop3 project is here [[+Bashpop3Documentation]]

The detailed script description is here [[+Bashpop3Script]] 

There are also some notes [[+ZIM|here]]  about using ZIM to auto generate this web-site.
